# Multi-Agent DDPG Implementation on PongDuel

The code here does NOT strictly comply with the implementation details as suggested in the paper [*Multi-Agent Actor-Critic for Mixed Cooperative-Competitive Environments*](Multi-Agent Actor-Critic for Mixed Cooperative-Competitive Environments). 

Instead, it's more like a not-so-sound multi-agent variation of the DDPG algorithm. But the code should be much more friendly for RL beginners. 

will complete the TODOs ASAP...
